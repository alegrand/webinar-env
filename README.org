This repository contains the slides for the second webinar: Controlling your environment.

First clone the repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/camilo1729/webinar-env.git
#+END_SRC

Then, download the beamer theme:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $ cd webinar-env/
 $ bash download_theme.sh
#+END_SRC

You can build a Docker image for compiling out of the box:


#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $ docker build -t webinar_environment .
#+END_SRC

This will take several minutes, given that it will install in the container
several latex packages. The resulting container will be big ~ 2GB.
For running the container and editing the presentation:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $ docker run -i -t -v /root/webinar-env:/presentation webinar /bin/bash
#+END_SRC
